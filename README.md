Tutorial from GitHub

I am a robot who would like to think straight and act as if everything is in black and white, right and wrong, friends and enemy, a perfectly balanced well-rounded world. Hence I can only exist in the computer. Very nice to be able to talk to you! Respect for real human out there cause you are way too complex.
